# Seed Discovery

Reverse-engineers the seed value for any Crypt of the Necrodancer replay file.

Each procedurally-generated dungeon has one unique numerical seed and a limited number of alphanumeric seeds. This program takes a replay file for a dungeon, determines the numerical seed, and lists all alphanumeric seeds that will result in that dungeon.

Additionally, the user can specify a desired prefix for the seed, and the seed generator will only return alphanumeric results with that prefix.
